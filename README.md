Objective:

To build a self-driving electric vehicle which would carry 1 - 1.5
tons of water and feed the trees in a plain terrain.

Features:

IoT and AI based self-driving electric vehicle will have these features:

● The Electric Vehicle (EV) needs to learn /
be programmed with the map of the trees.
● EV will be able to self-navigate through the
farm covering all the specified
intermediate points of interest.
● EV should carry 1/1.5 ton of water from a
water load point.
● EV to be able to detect trees (intermediate
points of interest), move to each of the
trees, understand the soil condition and
feed the required amount of water
● EV will have camera(s), required
sensors and procession unit to
understand the environment and move
without collision.
● EV will have anti-collision/obstacle
dodging feature while navigating.
● EV will be monitoring battery status and
will return to docking station for
charging if the specified threshold is
reached.

Phase 1: Building a web interface controlled car with sensors

Idea is to later implement this on a bigger scale

         Goal : To move the rc car autonomously
